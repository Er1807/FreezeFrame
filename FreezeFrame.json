Freeze Frames can be stacked and all Freeze Frames can be deleted afterward.\nThe buttons to create an delete Freeze Frames are found in the action menu and on the player quick menu\n\n With [VRCWS](https://github.com/Er1807/VRCWS) the event of taking a freeze is synchronized between all members in the lobby that also have VRCWS and FreezeFrame and are connected to the same VRCWS server",
